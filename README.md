#### Phaser3 + ES6 + Webpack

Boilerplate Phaser3 + ES6 project template based on https://github.com/nkholski/phaser3-es6-webpack and https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template

# Setup

```npm install```

or if you choose yarn, just run ```yarn```

Run:

```npm run dev```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter localhost:3000 into the address bar.

Also this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser


## Build for deployment:

Run:

```npm run deploy```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
